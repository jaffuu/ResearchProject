# ResearchProject

Abstract
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that will be used to predict the Sex of Abalones based on their physical measurements and weight attributes. The dataset includes features such as length, diameter and numerous weight measurements that will be used to create this prediction model. two different tests were performed, one where only the included features were used and one with feature engineering, where new features such as volume, interactions terms and weight ratios. PyCarets was used to automate the experience of preprocessing, model comparison and optimization. for the base test, the best model found was lr using Logistic Regression with an accuracy score of 0.5542 and an F1 score of 0.5362. the best model found when using feature engineering was ridge using Ridge Classifier with an accuracy score of 0.5549 and an F1 score of 0.5370.
